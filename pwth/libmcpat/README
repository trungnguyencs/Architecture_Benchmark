McPAT: Multicore Power, Area, and Timing
Current version 0.6Beta 
===============================

McPAT is an architectural modeling tool for chip multiprocessors (CMP)
The main focus of McPAT is accurate power and area
modeling, and a target clock rate is used as a design constraint. 
McPAT performs automatic extensive search to find optimal designs 
that satisfy the target clock frequency.  

Current McPAT is in its beta release. 
List of features of beta release
===============================
The following are the list of features supported by the tool. 

* Power, area, and timing models for CMPs with:
      Inorder cores both single and multithreaded
      OOO cores both single and multithreaded
      Shared/coherent caches with directory hardware
      Network-on-Chip
      On-chip memory controllers
    
* Internal models are based on real modern processors:
  Inorder models are based on Sun Niagara family
  OOO models are based on Intel P6 for reservation 
  station based OOO cores, and on Intel Netburst and 
  Alpha 21264 for physical register file based OOO cores.     

* Leakage power modeling considers both sub-threshold leakage 
  and gate leakage power. The impact of operating temperature 
  on both leakage power are considered.
  
* McPAT supports automatic extensive search to find optimal designs 
  that satisfy the target clock frequency. The timing constraint 
  include both throughput and latency.

* Interconnect model with different delay, power, and area 
  properties, as well as both the aggressive and conservative 
  interconnect projections on wire technologies. 

* All process specific values used by the McPAT are obtained
  from ITRS and currently, the McPAT supports 90nm, 65nm, 45nm, 
  32nm, and 22nm technology nodes. At 32nm and 22nm nodes, SOI 
  and DG devices are used. After 45nm, Hi-K metal gates are used.

How to use the tool?
====================

McPAT takes input parameters from an XML-based interface,
then it computes area and peak power of the 
Please note that the peak power is the absolute worst case power, 
which could be even higher than TDP. 

1. Steps to run McPAT:
   -> define the target processor using inorder.xml or OOO.xml 
   -> run the "mcpat" binary:
      ./mcpat -infile <*.xml>  -print_level < level of detailed output>
      ./mcpat -h (or mcpat --help) will show the quick help message.

   Rather than being hardwired to certain simulators, McPAT 
   uses an XML-based interface to enable easy integration
   with various performance simulators. Our collaborator, 
   Richard Strong, at University of California, San Diego, 
   designed an experimental parser for the M5 simulator, aiming for 
   streamlining the integration of McPAT and M5. Please check the M5 
   repository/ for the latest version of the parser.


2. Optimize:
   McPAT will try its best to satisfy the target clock rate. 
   When it cannot find a valid solution, it gives out warnings, 
   while still giving a solution that is closest to the timing 
   constraints and calculate power based on it. The optimization 
   will lead to larger power/area numbers for target higher clock
   rate. McPAT also provides the option "-opt_for_clk" to turn on
   and off this strict optimization for the timing constraint. In
   beta release, -opt_for_clk is by default off, this is because 
   most the target clock target clock rate is within reasonable 
   range(e.g.<4GHz@45nm). And by turning it off, the computation 
   time can be reduced. When it is off, McPAT always optimize 
   component for EDP without worrying about meeting the target clock
   frequency.Users can turn it on by using "-opt_for_clk 1".  
  
   
   
   
3. The output:
   McPAT outputs results in a hierarchical manner. Increasing 
   the "-print_level" will show detailed results inside each 
   component. For each component, major parts are shown, and associated 
   pipeline registers/control logic are added up in total area/power of each 
   components.

For complete documentation of the McPAT, please refer McPAT 1.0
technical report and the following paper,
"McPAT: An Integrated Power, Area, and Timing Modeling
 Framework for Multicore and Manycore Architectures", 
that appears in MICRO 2009. Please cite this paper, if you use
McPAT in your work.

McPAT is in its beginning stage. We are still improving 
the tool and refining the code. Please come back to website 
frequently for newer versions. If you have any comments,
